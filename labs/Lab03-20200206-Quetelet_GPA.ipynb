    ">THE Gladiator is certainly one of the most beautiful works of ancient sculpture. It is with reason that artists have studied its free and noble forms, and have often measured the principal dimensions of the head and of the body to obtain its proportions and its harmony. To measure a statue is not so easy an operation as might at first appear, particularly if it be desired to obtain very precise results. In measuring ten times in succession the circumference of the chest, we are not sure of finding two results identically the same. It almost always happens that the values obtained are more or less distant from that sought; and I even suppose the most favourable circumstances those where there is no tendency to make the measurements either too small or too great. If we had the courage to recommence a thousand times, we should in the end have a series of numbers differing from one another, according to the degree of precision exercised in their collection. The mean of all these numbers would certainly differ very little from the true value."

The single act of respiration, which causes each instant a variation of the form and dimension of the chest, would add a powerful cause of error to those which concur in operating on a perfectly motionless statue. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, the thousand measurements grouped in order of magnitude would yet proceed in a most regular manner.

    ">The example which I have cited merits, I think, great attention: it shows us that the results really occur, as though the chests which have been measured had been modelled from the same type from the same individual,—an ideal one if you will, but whose proportions we ascertain by a sufficiently long trial. If such were not the law of nature, the measurements would not (spite of their imperfections) group themselves with the astonishing symmetry which the law of possibility assigns them. Of the admirable laws which Nature attaches to the preservation of the species, I think I may put in the first rank that of maintaining the type. In my work on *La Physique Sociale*, I have already endeavoured to determine this type by the knowledge of the human mean. But if I mistake not, what experiment and reasoning had shown me, here takes the character of a mathematical truth. The human type, for men of the same race, and of the same age, is so well established that the differences between the results of observation and of calculation, notwithstanding the numerous accidental causes which might induce or exaggerate them, scarcely exceed those which unskilfulness may produce in a series of measurements taken on one individual. \n",
    "\n",
    "He continues:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The difference which Nature makes in the heights of men is not greater than that which inexperience would produce in the measurements taken on one individual man in an attitude more or less curved. Everything occurs then as though there existed a type of man, from which all other men differed more or less. Nature has placed before our eyes living examples of what theory shows us."

    ">Quetelet distinguished three kinds of mean values, the presentation of which would provide the core of numerous statistical debates until the beginning of the twentieth century. When Adolphe Bertillon (1876) presented these distinctions thirty years after Quetelet, he designated them quite clearly. The *objective* mecm corresponded to a real object, subjected to a certain number of measurements. The *subjective* mean resulted from the calculation of a central tendency, in the case in which the distribution presented a form adjustable to that of the “binomial law” (the case of heights). Only these two cases really deserved the term “mean value.” The third case presented itself as if the distribution did not have this “normal” form at all. Bertillon termed it an arithmetical mcan to emphasize the fact that it was pure fiction (the example he gave was that of the height of the houses in a street, without any such distribution being offered in support), whereas in the second case, the normal form of a frequency histogram attests to the existence of an underlying perfection in the multiplicity of cases, justifying the calculation of a “true” mean value."

    "### From physical to moral\n",
    "\n",
    ">The second crucial connection in Quetelet’s construct allowed him to associate moral behavior with the physical attributes previously studied. Indeed, both moral and physical attributes present on average, as has been seen, an important regularity, if one only considers the masses. The average heights and forms of the human body show little variety, and that is explained by the law of large numbers, if the diversity of individual cases is interpreted in terms of realizations deviating at random from a model, according to a sum of numerous, small, independent causes. If therefore the heights of individual men are rather far apart, the average heights of two or more groups of men are actually quite close, if only these groups have been composed at random. *Now the numbers of marriages, crimes, or suicides present the same kind of stability, despite the highly individual and free nature of each of these three acts.* The connection between these two types of regularities, having to do with masses rather than singular cases, some with physical attributes and others with moral characteristics, allows us to clinch the argument: decisions of the moml type are manifes- tations of tendmcies distributed at random around average types. Com- bined, they constitute the moral attributes of the average man—an ideal intended by the Creator, and a symbol of perfection. [76-7, our italics]"
