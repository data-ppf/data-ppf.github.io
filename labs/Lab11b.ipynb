    "\n",
    "In a 2016 [article](\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\") on Propublica, the authors announced, there's \"software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks.\" The proprietary software in question was COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) that sought to provide judges and other officials predictions about recidivism based on a number of factors. Because the algorithm is proprietary, it is a commercial black box if not an epistemological one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining records from freedom of information requests in Florida and arrest records, the team of journalists and data scientists used *supervised learning* to build a model capable of fairly accurately reproducing the predictions of the COMPAS algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we've seen how *supervised learning* models the judgment of human experts without claiming to replicate their reasoning processes. Same thing here, but reproducing the products of a different algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key result was:\n",
    ">In forecasting who would re-offend, the algorithm made mistakes with black and white defendants at roughly the same rate but in very different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    ">+ The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants.\n",
    "+ White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what that involves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team described its process in a detailed [blogpost](\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm\") and [notebook](\"https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/blob/master/Compas%20Analysis.ipynb\"). \n",

    ">ProPublica created a linear explanation model for COMPAS that depended on race, and then accused the black box COMPAS model of depending on race, conditioned on age and criminal history. In fact, COMPAS seems to be nonlinear, and it is entirely possible that COMPAS does not depend on race (beyond its correlations with age and criminal history). .  ProPublica’s linear model was not truly an “explanation” for COMPAS, and they should not have concluded that their explanation model uses the same important features as the black box it was approximating. [...] Let us stop calling approximations to black box model predictions explanations. For a model that does not use race explicitly, an automated explanation “This model predicts you will be arrested because you are black” is not an explanation of what the model is actually doing, and would be confusing to a judge, lawyer or defendant.
